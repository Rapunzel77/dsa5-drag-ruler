# TDE 5 Drag Ruler Integration (Das Schwarze Auge)

A FoundryVTT module that adds a speed provider to Drag Ruler for TDE5/DSA5.

## Details

How Drag Ruler functions depends on the type of actor.

Correct attributes will be used for PC and NPC. 
Sprinting for action is indicated as second threshold (speed * 2)

## Limitations

Only works with the official TDE5/DSA5 speeds. Multiple movement types are not supported here as they are not 
supported by TDE5/DSA5. For example, birds that could fly or walk. Only the configured speed in the sheet is used.
