# TDE 5 Drag Ruler Integration (Das Schwarze Auge)

A FoundryVTT module that adds a speed provider to Drag Ruler for TDE.

## Details

How Drag Ruler functions depends on the type of actor.

Correct attributes will be used for PC and NPC. 
Sprinting for action is indicated as second threshold (speed * 2) 

## Limitations

Does not work nicely for any token that has multiple movement types. 
For example, birds that could fly or walk. Only the configured speed in the sheet is used.
