# TDE 5 Drag Ruler Integration (Das Schwarze Auge)

A FoundryVTT module that adds a speed provider to Drag Ruler for TDE5/DSA5.

## Details

How Drag Ruler functions depends on the type of actor.

Correct attributes will be used for PC and NPC. 
Sprinting for action is indicated as second threshold (speed * 2) 

## Limitations

Only works with the official THE5 speeds. Multiple movement types are not supported here as they are not 
supported by THE5. For example, birds that could fly or walk. Only the configured speed in the sheet is used.
